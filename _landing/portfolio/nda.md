excerpt: Webpage, patient management system, Web Application for patients
---
The company had a preexisting patient management system written in a custom framework created by a previous provider. The application they had developed didn't provide value to their customers and couldn't evolve. Me and an additional developer rewrote the application in a few months using newer technologies that were easier to maintain, while keeping the previous database. 

# Teamwork
I was in charge of the majority of the development work after the initial prototype, and of managing and scheduling the colaboration with [Maria Florencia Belasio](https://www.behance.net/mflorbelasio) (the graphic designer), [Juan Francisco Sbruzzi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/juan-francisco-sbruzzi-trq/) (the additional developer), and the clients.

# Extensive testing
Given the large number of screens and user stories supported, and how critical the software is for the functioning of NDA, the application has an extensive test suite that is ran constantly and assures that no bugs reach the users.

# Agility
'NDA: Nutrici贸n en Acci贸n' was fully commited to the principles of the [Agile](https://agilemanifesto.org/), with constant communication and delivery of value.
