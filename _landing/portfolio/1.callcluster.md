excerpt: Tool for analyzing, visualizing and improving source code
---
This is the final work of my engineering degree, with [Mariano MÃ©ndez, Phd](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Mariano-Mendez-6) as my tutor. The tool is a combination of multiple technologies to solve the complex task of parsing and extracting information about the structures of programs from their source code. The application is composed of three components:

- Analyzer for C# (written in C#)
- Analyzer for C (written in C)
- Visualizer: an electronjs application that uses vue and javascript to generate interactive visualizations

This was a very challenging project that demanded a comprehensive research stage in which I had to develop prototypes, read multiple research papers, propose an architecture and develop it.

The source code will be available soon, and the documentation is only available in spanish.
